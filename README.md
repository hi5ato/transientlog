# A transient /var/log for Raspberry Pi

# This project was abandoned
My Raspberry Pi has been broken last year.
I can not maintain this software anymore.
Please use  [log2ram](https://github.com/azlux/log2ram).

Thank you.

# abstract
Write the log on memory, not on disk.
For Raspberry Pi or other SD card linux.
I test on raspbian.

This code from [A transient /var/log : Debian Administration](https://www.debian-administration.org/article/661/A_transient_/var/log).

Thanks for [Matteo Cortese](https://www.debian-administration.org/users/mcortese).
